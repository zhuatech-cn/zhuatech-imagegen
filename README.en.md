# ZhuaTech ImageGen

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for enterprise AI-assisted workflows with human governance.

ZhuaTech ImageGen provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for enterprise AI-assisted workflows with human governance. It is designed for business operators, domain reviewers, AI teams, and administrators, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise imagegen, self-hosted imagegen, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Product Scope

- **Primary users:** Business operators, domain reviewers, AI teams, and administrators.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Capability Map

- **Creative Project** — Manage creative project with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Generation Job** — Coordinate generation job through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Structured business inputs** — Track structured business inputs metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Rule-based local execution mode** — Preserve rule-based local execution mode evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Provider-neutral AI integration interface** — Expose provider-neutral ai integration interface in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Human review and confidence controls** — Connect human review and confidence controls to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Technology Baseline

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Responsive HTML5 · Docker Compose
